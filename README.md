Project Overview:

This project is centered on applying supervised machine learning techniques to the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset.

The primary objective is twofold:

Model Identification: To systematically evaluate various classification algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, CART, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM) in order to identify the most suitable model configuration for the high-dimensional text data.

Inference: To utilize the best-performing model to automatically classify new, incoming movie reviews into distinct POSITIVE or NEGATIVE sentiment categories.

This work ensures the final output is a reliable and functional data-driven system capable of predicting public opinion from raw text in an effective manner.

📊 Dataset
The Dataset: IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

The dataset used is the IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset, who includes 50k review and sentiments.

Characteristics:
Data Type: Unstructured Text (Customer Reviews).

Volume: 50,000 reviews in total.

Target Task: Binary Classification (Positive/Negative sentiment).


⚙️ Methodology and Model Implementation
Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Text Cleaning: Implemented a custom cleaning function that preserves negation terms (not, no, etc.) to correctly capture polarity inversion.

TF-IDF Vectorizer: This tool converts text into weighted numerical features, giving higher scores to unique, distinctive words (like "disaster") over common ones to ensure the model focuses on meaning.

N-grams: Allows the model to recognize multi-word phrases, such as "not good" or "utterly predictable," as single contextual features, which significantly improves understanding of the sentiment.

Negation Handling: This step prevents the system from removing words like "not" or "never," ensuring that the model does not accidentally misread a negative sentence as positive.

Cross-Validation (CV): Repeatedly testing the model on different parts of the training data to confirm that our final performance score is dependable and not just a lucky guess from a single test.

Scaling: Three versions of the data are tested: 
        -Original (with no normalisation), 
        -Standard Scaler, 
        -Min Max Scaler

Models Used:
    -CART
    -KNN
    -Random Forest
    -Logistic Regression (LR)
    -Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM)

🧾 Key Results Summary

Logistic Regression (LR): Optimal classifier that we are using. Fastest and most reliable model for separating text classes, yielding the highest score.

Linear SVM (LSVM):	A strong linear alternative for the project. Confirmed the power of linear separation on high-dimensional text data.

Random Forest (RF):	Really stable; used in the project to verify that performance was completely unaffected by data scaling.

Decision Tree (CART): Used as the single-tree reference point to demonstrate the superior stability of the RF approach.

KNN: It proved that standard scaling can destroy the structure of sparse text features, causing catastrophic model failure.

🔮 Possible Improvements

-Adding more advanced text preprocessing (lemmatization, bigram filtering, negation scope detection).

-Testing richer vectorization methods (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT embeddings).

-Evaluating additional models

-Add more robust cross-validation (nested CV or increased K-Fold).
